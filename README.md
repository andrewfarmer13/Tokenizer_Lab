# Tokenizer_Lab

## Overview
In this project we build a Lexical analyzer that parses Jack programs according to the Jack grammar, producing an XML file that renders the program's structure using marked-up text. For each input .jack file, the analyzer should generate an .xml output file. The generated files should be identical to the supplied compare-files, up to white space.
